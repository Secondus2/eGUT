**Reference Implementation.** The implementation of JAMA downloadable from this site is meant to be a reference implementation only. As such, it is pedagogical in nature. The algorithms employed are similar to those of the classic Wilkinson and Reinsch Handbook, i.e. the same algorithms used in EISPACK, LINPACK and MATLAB. Matrices are stored internally as native Java arrays (i.e., double[][]). The coding style is straightforward and readable. While the reference implementation itself should provide reasonable execution speed for small to moderate size applications, we fully expect software vendors and Java VMs to provide versions which are optimized for particular environments.

**Not Covered.** JAMA is by no means a complete linear algebra environment. For example, there are no provisions for matrices with particular structure (e.g., banded, sparse) or for more specialized decompositions (e.g. Shur, generalized eigenvalue). Complex matrices are not included. It is not our intention to ignore these important problems. We expect that some of these (e.g. complex) will be addressed in future versions. It is our intent that the design of JAMA not preclude extension to some of these additional areas.
