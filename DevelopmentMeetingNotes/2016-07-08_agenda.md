Welcome to Jamie Luo from Warwick University

* Jamie's focus the coming months - filaments

Progress on iDyno 2 the past few weeks

### Coding general keypoints

* Random number usage
* Units
* well mixed boundary
* steady state reaction diffusion
* full non-cartesian simulation
* Clean-up
* Hunting and eliminating bugs

### Unfinished coding parts

agent package

* Agent register death method
* Make body relocate robust for relocations between 2d and 3d domains
* Adding complex body types with gui

aspect package

* Aspect redirerecting stored in output and editable in gui
* Thinkover - radii and agent size in 2d representation
* Remove or finish filial linkage methods
* in some scenarios eps cumulative seems to cause a stack overflow error
* investigate the usage of the internal production event now that rob has intergrated it (partly?) in transient diffusion solver
* level pull distance rather than adding up
* clean-up rod division and make sure rods perform tip-tip divide

Boundary package

* proper initiation from protocol file
* node construction
* detachment, attachment
* biofilm boudary implemenentation, uses aspects thus should become redirectable or restructured in an other way
* Membrane boundary layers are unfinished

dataIO

* Log: allow for different display and log file log levels

grid

* setting difusivity other than 1

guiTools

* A lot of classes are not implementing the model node structure yet and thus are not loaded in the gui yet.
* A lot of classes do not allow for editing (set node method missing or unfinished)

Agent container

* move all aspect related methods out of the agent container they should be in redirectable classes and angent container should remain general
* make rtree / splittree settable

JSBML

* is not used, leave out of release version if not used

nodeFactory

* finish replacing newBlank paradigm with constructable paradigm
* finish Bundle and Pile implementation

ProcessManagers

* upon event processManagers?

Shape

* what is still to be done for non-Cartesian shapes

Spatial registry

* splittree is faster but still has some glitches: artefacts with rods in periodic domains, high amount of overlap in one point will cause stack overflow
* spatial registry interface is biassed towards rTree

surface

* bounding volumes for non cartesian domains?
* Collision and adhesion functions settable from protocol file

### Writing: what is our status

* Good progress on general framework description
* case studies are hold back by unfinished code.

### Planning
