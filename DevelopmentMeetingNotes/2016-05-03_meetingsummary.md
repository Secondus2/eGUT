Present: Robert Clegg, Bastiaan Cockx, Stefan Lang

**Bas** has the library-as-a-subpackage implementation working, so Rob will clean up the ProcessManagers. Bas will write about it in the GuideForDevelopers

**Stefan** will test the shape stuff following Rob's restructuring, and create the getNewGrid() method in Shape (currently just a TODO)

**Bas** will start assigning manuscript writing roles, replace the citations in the Word file, and will add Stefan to the Mendeley group

**Rob** has asked Bas to implement the Cube surface object, but as low priority: this may be useful later in the eGUT project.

Some relevant things Rob has become aware of recently, that the others may be interested in:
 - The SOLID principles of object-oriented programming
 - JSON as a lightweight alternative to XML
 - The Constructor<?> class in Java
